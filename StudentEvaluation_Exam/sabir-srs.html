        <h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
        <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
        <p>The opening page will have two buttons for two portals. One for the faculty members and the other for the students.</p>
            <img src="Home.PNG" alt="" class="image">
            <p>The faculty portal will use image verification, username, and password for logging in. Same applies for the students.</p>
            <img src="Login.PNG" alt="" class="image">
        <p>The faculty will be able to click on student-cohorts("Sections"), and will be allowed to click on individual students
    to provide them "Reading Assignments", set the time and set "Quizzes" and time for them as well.</p>
            <img src="Faculty portal.PNG" alt="" class="image"><br>
            <img src="Upload RA.PNG" alt="" class="image"> 
            <p>They will receive detailed
reports of their performances upon completion of the assignments on the "Reports" section.</p>
            <img src="Reports.PNG" alt="" class="image"> 
            <p>This includes their aggregate results
that is their average in a histogramic form based on their performance on "Quizzes".</p>
            <img src="Reports-data.PNG" alt="" class="image"> 
            <p>More on that later. The faculty will be able to give 
"Reading Assignments" to all students instead of individually if they so choose.</p>
            <img src="Sections.PNG" alt="" class="image"> 
            <p>The student portal will contain "Reading Assignments"
 for them and upon clicking they will be shown the assignments and time for them. </p>
            <img src="Student-portal.PNG" alt="" class="image">    
            <p>And they'll be able to take quizzes at their
leisure and will be shown the time during each "Quiz."</p>

            <h3>3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h3>
